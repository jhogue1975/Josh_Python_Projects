Groing up we typicaly had 1 or 2 cats, 1 dog, and 4 fish. I enjoyed playing with the dog, however, I never really liked cats.
I think the reason I never cared much for cats was because they were mean and did not listen very well.
Dogs on the other hand were alsways so happy to see you when you came home and typically listened very well.
The fish on the other hand were simply fun to watch even though there was not much interaction with them.
Sometimes the fish would fight and take bites out of eachother and the fish that was the weakest woule not live too long.
