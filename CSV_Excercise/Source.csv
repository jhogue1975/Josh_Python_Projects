I think you give customers a refund, in my case for example, I was wondering what the two charges were for $14.95.  I was told because I have 2 websites listed with wix.com,  that's the annual cost of each.  I think wix.com owes me something.  It's going to take over 11 months before the two websites expire.  11 months gives the world plenty of time to make changes. 

Since I was only a little over three weeks behind, I think wix.com should give me a full refund.  Or maybe charge for one month and refund the rest.

She was kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and patient with my many questions.  I wish I could have her as my personal Wix contact!  I have looked at many other website creator sites (SnapPages is another one I was considering), but because of Wix's ease of use and the fantastic experience I had with your customer service, I am staying with Wix and will upgrade my account as soon as I have finished designing my site and am ready to launch.  

One small anomaly of my situation is that I'm out of the country in Brazil until July, and have more time than usual to dedicate to creating this site, but unfortunately it seems there is no way to have my account recognized as an American one, so that I have access to all the newest and best features available (and also so that I'm not seeing everything in Brazilian currency as I'm looking at the Premium packages).  It would be very nice if there was an option so that I can set my site as an American one permanently, since I do have to travel internationally quite often, and wouldn't want to have to deal with the differences in available features while I'm out of the US.

You've given me information above and beyond, you speak English, not binary and you're NICE while you're doing it.  Rest assured that, as long as WIX continues to operate in this manner, you've got a customer for life. I worked in sales & marketing for many years and let me say that, you may be part of tech support, but you're the best sales tool WIX has.  You can't buy this kind of advertising ANYWHERE. I wish I could work with you guys.  When it comes time to upgrade guess who I'm calling. Yes, feel free to use these rantings and ravings of a mad man as a testimonial...it's only the truth.

The first time I spoke w/Yasu, to inquire about upgrading, she was extremely cordial.  Although I had some difficulty understanding her, she did take the time to answer my questions, which is why I specifically requested to speak with her when I called back to upgrade.  Yes, she was still nice, but when  1) I made some errors on the upgrade page and 2) I had some difficulty understanding her, a certain amount of sarcasm surfaced.  i.e. ""this is a very SIMPLE question I'm asking you.""  Also, she was obviously in a hurry regarding the domain issue, ""I need to explain this to you very quickly, very quickly.""  Noticing that it was 4:35 pm, you guys close at 5pm and my laptop was running slow,  I offered to call back the next day to finish.  Her reply ""You mean I get to talk to you again tomorrow, what a lucky girl I am.""  The words by themselves, no problem.  Listen to the recording.  The TONE is sarcastic and somewhat condescending.  I say this because, 1) up to now, my experiences with WIX have been very positive-take a look at the feedback I sent regarding Holly, Dan and Adison  2) this was a relatively minor irritant...I have pretty thick skin, but another customer may not feel the same way.  I worked in sales & marketing for many years and now use what I learned to sell my services.  Your tech support people do a better job of selling based on their phone demeanor alone.

I would have given extra credit if WIX allowed cut and paste to alleviate  the burden of having to retype what has already been typed.   However,  such  inconvenience doesn't taint my overall experience with WIX.

As a contact I had with customer service and I told them, again I appreciate it for the wonderful services that you gave everyone to be able to make the beautiful website for free!!! and it is appreciated.
But as I told to the customer service, when I opened my account more than 2 years ago, when I changed my username and after a few seconds I wanted to return to my first username, it didn't work and I couldn't  get back my username!
If you can also find the one solution for this case, in my opinion it'll perfect.
And one more thing, it's not complaint, no, just for the speed wix.com is not very fast and if also you can find the any solution for more speed it'll be amazing.
I have a few account in wix.com and I use them and I'm very glad for that and again I appreciated.

With the option to buy more domains being separate. If I'm paying to remove ads on one site, I would like to remove the ads on all my sites, but it is far too expensive so I will not be using wix for more than one site at a time.

I can understand if I am designing for clients why it would be fair to have the premium service be on a per-site basis if I pay to upgrade my service to premium and I'm designing for a bunch of clients who have not paid then you all do not make money off of removing ads from their sites if it is not charged on a per-site basis.

But most designers I know opt to have clients open their own account, having one client log on and have access to every other client's website is not secure at all.

In the future, opting to pay for an account-wide premium status would be ideal. 

It would also be nice to have an option that just pays for ad removal without the domain.

Aesthetically Wix can't be beat, but price-wise there are many more options for people who don't mind if their site isn't as pretty or Web 2.0 optimized.

NEVER NEVER NEVER MINIMIZE YOUR  PROBLEM AS ""WELL ITS NOT SYSTEM WIDE"" WHEN IT IS COMPLETELY TAKING MY SYSTEM OFF LINE.  I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT ONE SITE.  YOU MAY HAVE THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS I DON'T AND I TAKE CARE OF MINE AS IF MY BUSINESS DEPENDED ON IT   AS IT DOES!!!!  TAKE A LOOK AT MY ACCOUNT AND YOU CAN MEASURE HOW I USE YOUR SERVICES.  MAYBE IT DOESN'T MEAN ENOUGH TO YOU TO TREAT  MY CALL WITH RESPECT BUT IT IS CLEARLY MY EXPECTATION.

WHEN ALL OF MY SITES 30+ ARE DOWN, YOU ADVISED ME IT WAS SYSTEM WIDE AND THEN CALLED BACK TO SAY YOU WERE WRONG BUT THAT IT WASN'T THAT BAD OF SA SITUATION SINCE JUST ONE SERVER WAS DOWN.  WELL THAT SERVER MUST HAVE ALL MY BUSINESS.   YOUR CALL ONLY SHOWED ME YOU HAD LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.

DO NOT TELL ME THERE ARE SYSTEM BACK UPS IN PLACE WHEN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE FAILED AND MY BUSINESS IS BEING AFFECTED BY THIS ERROR.

DO NOT EVER EVER EVER USE THE TERM ""SWEETIE""  I AM A 58 YEAR OLD BUSINESS PERSON WORKING FOR MYSELF AND IN NO WAY AM YOUR SWEETIE.   THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO YOU AND YOUR COMPANY.  I SERIOUSLY WILL CONSIDER SELECTING ANOTHER SOURCE FOR MY BUSINESS BASED SOLELY ON THE CAVALIER LEVEL OF RESPONSE YOU CHOSE TO PRESENT.  TAKE A LOOK AT MY ACCOUNT TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH I HAVE USED YOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  I AM NOT AND NEVER WILL SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITH SUCH A POOR EXAMPLE OF CONCERN TO MYSELF OR MY BUSINESS AND WITH SUCH A CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE AS ""SWEETIE""!!
